A new music streaming service that only plays songs 
<br>that no-one has listened to on Spotify has been launched.<br><br>
The founders of Forgotify said that the <br>four million unheard tracks were "a musical travesty".<br><br>
<font size="6">
'Neglected songs'<br></p>
<p><font size="5"></b>
Jazzy American Ballads for Piano, and Sally in Our Alley,
<br> Op. 108, No. 25 by Robert White from the album 
<br>"Robert White Sings Beethoven (Remastered)" were 
<br>two examples of the unheard tracks listed on the new service.<br><br><b>
Mr Jordan said in an interview with Time that the website</b>
<br> uses an embedded Spotify player and runs a program searching <br>
Spotify for songs with a "0â€³ popularity rating, indicating that<br>
 the song has never been selected by a user.<br><br>
He said any song that has been played even once is removed.<br><br>
Although he added that the four million unlistened-to tracks<br>
 are unlikely to decline as Spotify adds new music all the time.<br>
Twitter users were keen to talk about the new service but one <br>
did wonder how popular the music would be.
