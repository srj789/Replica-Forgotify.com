 Forgotify tears through Spotify in search of songs with zero plays,<br> 
 playing only the songs that no one else has ever listened to.<br><br></b>
 Wrong. According to data that Spotify released in October of last year, <br>
 80% of the 20-million-or-so songs on Spotify have been listened to at least once.<br>
 That means 20% of the songs have not. That's 4 million songs with zero plays.<br><br>
 One crazy thought: when you listen to a song on Forgotify,
<br>
 it increases that song’s play count… meaning that, <br>
 if this thing is working correctly,
<br> no one will ever hear it again.
<br> Each experience becomes ephemeral.
